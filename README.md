## Installation Guide
1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
   - Clone the project to your local machine from the GitHub repository using the following command in the command prompt or terminal
   in your IDE: **git clone <GitHub_repository_URL>**

2. **Application Configuration:**
   - The project has a **default** profile and a **test** profile. For the default profile, the `profile` section (in the application.yml) should be left empty.
   - When using the default profile, you can log in with the email `"admin@gmail.com"` and password `"admin"` on the `http://localhost:8080/system/login` page, 
   but there won't be any stored data in the database. 
     - It's predefined in the Main class, but You can use your own email address or register a new account and grant yourself administrator rights 
     with the `"admin@gmail.com"` account.<br><br>
   - When using the **"test"** profile, the database is populated with predefined data from the `test-data.sql` file. 
   - There are two predefined users: `"admin@gmail.com"` with the password `"admin"`, and `"user@gmail.com"` with the password `"user"`. 
   - The passwords are not encrypted to facilitate easier testing (config package - TestConfiguration). 
   - The admin has administrator privileges, while the user has regular user privileges.
   - Select the desired profile in the application.yml file with the setting "profiles: active:". 
   - Both profiles use a MySQL database.

3. **Database Creation and Initialization:**
   - Create a database with your own settings, then set the **URL**, **username**, and **password** in the application.yml file. 
   - If the application successfully connects to the database, the schema is automatically generated.

4. **Email Configuration:**
   - If you want to use email sending for registration, password change, etc. (recommended), set your email address in the application.yml file 
   from which the system will send notifications to users. 
   - If you're using Gmail, use your own email address for the username and a generated password from Gmail for the password. 
     - You can find more information about Gmail passwords [here](https://medium.com/@seonggil/send-email-with-spring-boot-and-gmail-27c14fc3d859).

5. **Starting the Application:**
   - Once all configurations are set, start the application and test its functionality.

6. **Testing:**
   - Ensure that the application functions properly. If you encounter any issues or have questions, you can find my contact information in the contacts section!
